The **School Management System** is a Java laboratory activity designed to model real-world school entities using object-oriented programming principles. The program implements inheritance through a base Person class extended by Student and Teacher, demonstrating IS-A relationships, while aggregation is used to associate Teacher objects with one or more Course objects. All classes are contained in a single file named TeacherStudentAssignment.java, showcasing the use of constructors, the super keyword, and method overriding to display student, teacher, and course information. This project reinforces the practical application of inheritance and aggregation in building a simple yet structured Java school management system for educational purposes.
