The **MyBookList** project is a Java console application created as part of a laboratory activity to demonstrate core object-oriented programming concepts. The program uses a Book class to store and manage book information such as title, author, year published, and current page, while MyBookList.java showcases how to create multiple book objects, display their details, update properties using methods, and store them in an array. It also includes looping logic to filter and display books published after 2010, reinforcing the use of classes, constructors, methods, and arrays in Java within an educational setting.
