The **Order Management System** is a Java laboratory activity focused on applying abstraction and encapsulation in a real-world online store scenario. The project uses packages to organize responsibilities, an OrderStatus enum to represent fixed order states, an abstract Order class to define common order behavior, and a Payable interface to enforce payment actions. A concrete OnlineOrder class extends and implements these abstractions while maintaining strict encapsulation through private fields, validated setters, and controlled access via getters. The system manages multiple orders using an ArrayList<Order> and safely traverses them with an Iterator to display summaries and remove cancelled orders, reinforcing best practices in abstraction, encapsulation, and collection management in Java.
