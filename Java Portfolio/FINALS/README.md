The **Java Swing To-Do List Application** is an object-oriented program designed to help students manage their school tasks efficiently. The system uses an abstract AbstractTask class as the parent for Task and TimedTask subclasses, applying inheritance, encapsulation, and method overriding to organize task data such as ID, name, description, status, and estimated time. A TaskManager class handles operations like adding, updating, and viewing tasks, while the Swing-based user interface displays tasks in a JTable and provides a separate form window to add new tasks. The application ensures only one form window is open at a time, validates inputs before saving, and dynamically updates the task list, demonstrating a practical implementation of OOP principles in Java.
