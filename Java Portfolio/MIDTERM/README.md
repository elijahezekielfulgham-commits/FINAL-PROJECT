The **Smart Home Management System** is a Java console application that demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation through a simulated smart home environment. The program defines a base Device class extended by specific devices such as LightBulb and Thermostat, each overriding methods to display device-specific information and behavior. Polymorphism is showcased by storing different device objects in a Device array and controlling them through a single SmartHomeController, while static members track the total number of devices created. The system allows devices to be turned on and off collectively, displays detailed device information, and models real-world smart home interactions using object-oriented principles in Java.
