The **Coffee Shop Rewards System** is a Java console-based program developed as a laboratory exercise for BeanBrew Coffee Shop to demonstrate key object-oriented programming concepts. The project features a Customer class that uses instance variables, static variables, default and parameterized constructors, and methods to manage customer reward points, redeem free drinks, and track the total number of registered customers. The CoffeeShop main class simulates real-world transactions by creating multiple customers, adding points from purchases, redeeming rewards, displaying customer information using static methods, and calculating how many rewards a customer can redeem. This project applies Java OOP principles in a practical rewards system scenario for educational purposes.
