The **Library Management System** is a simple console-based Java application developed for Campus Library Systems to manage basic library operations. The system allows librarians to add new books (with a default status of *Available*), update book statuses between *Available* and *Borrowed*, display all registered books, and generate a summary report showing total, available, and borrowed books. It uses arrays with a maximum limit of five books, applies loops, conditionals, and switch-case statements for menu handling, and is structured using modular methods such as `addBook()`, `updateBookStatus()`, `showBooks()`, and `generateReport()`. This project is designed to demonstrate fundamental Java programming concepts and is intended for educational purposes.
