The **Smart Home Control System** is a Java laboratory activity that demonstrates runtime polymorphism and method overriding through a simulated smart home environment. The project models different smart devices—such as an air conditioner, lamp shade, television, and microwave oven—under a common parent device class, allowing polymorphic references and dynamic binding when turning devices on or off and displaying their unique states. Encapsulation is applied to protect device attributes, with setters printing updated statuses, while static methods at the device level manage power control and count active devices using a collection of parent-type references. This project showcases practical object-oriented design using inheritance, polymorphism, and real-world device interactions in Java.
